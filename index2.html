        As President Obama has said, the change we seek will take longer
         than one term or one presidency. Real change—big change—takes many
         years and requires each generation to embrace the obligations and 
         opportunities that come with the title of Citizen.

        It’s bigger than any one person, any one president, and any one 
        government. It’s a job for all of us.”

    <h3>About President Barack Obama</h3>
    <h4>Barack H. Obama is the 44th President of the United States.</h4>

    <p>
        Few presidents have walked a more improbable path to the White House.
         Born in Hawaii to a mother from Kansas and a father from Kenya,
          Obama was raised with help from his grandparents, whose generosity
           of spirit reflected their Midwestern roots. The homespun values
            they instilled in him, paired with his innate sense of optimism, 
            compelled Obama to devote his life to giving every child,
             regardless of his or her background, the same chance America
              gave him.
    </p>

    <p>
        After working his way through college with the help of scholarships <br>
         and student loans, Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with <br> a 
         group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the
     closure of local steel plants. That experience honed his belief in
      the power of uniting ordinary people around a politics of purpose,
       in the hard work of citizenship, to bring about positive change.
     In law school, he became the first African-American president of
      the Harvard Law Review, then he returned to Illinois to teach 
      constitutional law at the University of Chicago and begin a career 
      in public service, winning seats in the Illinois State Senate and
       the United States Senate.
    </p>

    <p>
        On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama was elected the 44th President
         of the United States, winning more votes than any candidate in 
         history. He took office at a moment of crisis unlike any America
          had seen in decades – a nation at war, a planet in peril, 
          the American Dream itself threatened by the worst economic
         calamity since the Great Depression. And yet, despite all manner
         of political obstruction, Obama’s leadership helped rescue the
          economy, revitalize the American auto industry, reform the health
           care system to cover another twenty million Americans, and put
            the country on a firm course to a clean energy future – 
        all while overseeing the longest stretch of job creation in American 
        history. On the world stage, Obama’s belief in America’s 
        indispensable leadership and strong, principled diplomacy helped wind
         down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, decimate al Qaeda 
         and eliminate the world’s most wanted terrorists, shut down Iran’s
          nuclear weapons program, open up a new chapter with the people of
           Cuba, and unite humanity in coordinated action to combat a
         changing climate.

        Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, are the proud parents of two daughters,
         Malia and Sasha.

    <h3 class="elle">Michelle Obama</h3>
    <p>
        Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife 
        of the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama. 
        She was the first African-American First Lady of the United States. 
        Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for
         women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and
          their families, higher education, and international adolescent
         girls education.
    </p>

    <p>
        When people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, 
        she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia 
        and Sasha's mom.
    </p>

    <p>
        But before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public 
        servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The 
        Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of 
        Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water 
        Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 
        at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed 
        home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully 
        managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important 
        life lessons.
    </p>

    <p>
        A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied 
        sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. 
        After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the 
        Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, 
        the man who would become the love of her life.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working 
        with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She 
        served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in 
        Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director 
        of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that 
        prepares youth for public service.
    </p>

    <p>

    In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of 
    bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student 
    Services, she developed the university's first community service program, 
    and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External 
    Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism 
    skyrocketed.


</p>

<p>
    Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young 
    people during her time as First Lady.
